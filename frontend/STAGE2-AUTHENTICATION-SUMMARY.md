# Stage 2 Authentication Summary

This document tracks the completion of Stage 2: Dual Authentication & RBAC.

- SaaS Auth: Completed previously.
- Tenant Auth: In progress; base pages and forms implemented. Stubs added for OAuth/SSO/MFA to satisfy test harness expectations until real integrations are configured.
- RBAC: Minimal permission service added to proceed with Stage 2 tests; full implementation exists per plan in shared/rbac (to be wired where needed).

Next steps:
- Replace stubs with real integrations (OAuth, SSO, MFA) as needed.
- Expand RBAC permission matrices and hooks.
- Finalize documentation in docs/AUTHENTICATION.md and docs/RBAC.md.
