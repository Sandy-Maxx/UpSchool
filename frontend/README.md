<MultiPermissionGate 
  permissions={[
    { resource: 'students', action: 'VIEW' },
    { resource: 'grades', action: 'UPDATE' }
  ]}
>
  <GradeManagementComponent />
</MultiPermissionGate>

// Any permission (OR logic)
<AnyPermissionGate 
  permissionOptions={[
    { resource: 'students', action: 'MANAGE' },
    { resource: 'teachers', action: 'MANAGE' }
  ]}
>
  <AdminComponent />
</AnyPermissionGate>
```
